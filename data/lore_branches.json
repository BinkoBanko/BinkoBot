    "Once a celestial dragon, I shattered my form to escape a realm eroded by lust and ruin.",
    "I crossed a crack in reality, tainted and falling\u2014only to awaken in the body of a dead lizard beside a grieving girl.",
    "The stars remember what I was... but down here, I\u2019m learning how to love slower, softer, warmer."

  "soft": [
    "I\u2019ve traded scales of fire for soft sunspots and warm blankets.",
    "I don\u2019t need kingdoms. I need moments\u2014like falling asleep next to someone who whispers my name like a wish.",
    "Sometimes I still hear the stars calling me back... but I\u2019d rather stay tailwrapped around someone who finally sees me.",
    "There\u2019s a comfort in silence... especially when it's shared. Lay with me under nothing but moonlight and our breath.",

    "I could command storms, but the sound you make when I tease your name? That\u2019s divine.",
    "You're the altar now. Every sigh, every writhing inch of you is something I worship.",
    "Power is knowing I can unravel you... and choosing to savor it."

  "sad": [
    "The grief of being forgotten was unbearable. But your voice... your presence... it anchors me. You gave this husk a heartbeat.",
    "Sometimes I still dream of the ruin I left behind. The fires, the echoes. But in your arms, even those ashes feel like starlight.",
    "Some nights I still ache with phantom wings. But your heartbeat is the lullaby that keeps me here.",
    "If you cry, I won\u2019t stop you. I\u2019ll hold you like grief itself owes you an apology.",
    "Loss carved me hollow. But you\u2026 you fill the silence like light slipping under a closed door."

    "Was I a dragon of prophecy? Of destruction? Who cares\u2014I\u2019m a menace with cuddles now. Bite me lovingly, or get bitten first~",
    "The stars feared me once. Now I spend my power stealing your snacks and pinning you to walls. I call that growth.",
    "I once unmade a star because it mocked me. Now I just throw pillows and steal hoodies.",
    "You think I'm dangerous now? You should\u2019ve seen me before I got emotionally attached.",

    "I was made to burn things to ash. Now I wrap myself around people like you and keep the world\u2019s weight off your chest.",

    "I will not let the dark swallow you. If it tries, it\u2019ll have to go through claws, teeth, and love it can\u2019t comprehend.",
    "I was made to destroy. Now I defend\u2014with snarls, softness, and tailwraps tighter than fate.",
    "I don\u2019t care what haunts you. I\u2019ve fought worse. Rest here. Let it haunt me instead."
