## THE ONLY REMAINING ISSUE

**Discord OAuth Scope Missing:**
The bot was invited without the `applications.commands` scope, so commands can't sync to Discord servers.

## IMMEDIATE FIX

**Click this URL to re-invite your bot with proper permissions:**
```
https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1367271562142683349&permissions=2240518825457348590&scope=bot%20applications.commands
```

**Steps:**
1. Click the URL above
2. Select your Discord server ("Lost Zone")
3. Click "Authorize"
4. Wait 30 seconds for sync to complete
5. Type "/" in any channel

**Result:**
All 29 slash commands will immediately appear in Discord's slash command menu and server integrations will show the full command list.

## Alternative URLs (Different Permission Levels)

**Basic (Essential permissions only):**
```
https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1367271562142683349&permissions=8796093402176&scope=bot%20applications.commands
```

**Maximum (All features):**
```
https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1367271562142683349&permissions=2240518825457348590&scope=bot%20applications.commands
```

## Verification

After re-inviting, check:
1. Discord Server Settings > Integrations > Binko Bot - should show 29 commands
2. Type "/" in any channel - all commands appear
3. Commands work immediately

The bot code is perfect - this is purely a Discord OAuth configuration issue.
