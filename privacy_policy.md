## BinkoBot Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** [04/30/2025]

BinkoBot is a modular Discord companion bot designed for cozy, adaptive, and personalized vibes. It is intended for private or small community use. Here’s how it handles data:

---

### 🔍 What Data Does BinkoBot Collect?

#### 💬 User Interaction
- Commands sent by users (e.g., `/flirt`, `/affirm`, `/note`, `/setvibe`)
- Temporary preferences and responses

#### 📓 Notes & Private Logs
- Notes you save with `/note` are stored per-user in memory or a lightweight file
- These are **only visible to the user** and auto-purge after 24h of inactivity (or earlier if you run `/clear`)

#### 🌈 Vibe Tracking System
- Tracks your last selected vibe (`soft`, `chaotic`, `lewd`, etc.)
- Vibes expire after 24h inactivity
- Used to personalize bot responses and recommended content
- Stored in `user_vibes.json` and never shared

#### 🎶 Spotify Integration *(If enabled)*
- When authorized by you, BinkoBot may:
  - Read your public playlist to recommend songs matching mood
  - Never accesses private listening history or modifies your Spotify account
  - Tokens are stored only during active use and discarded immediately after

---

### 🧠 What BinkoBot Doesn’t Do
- ❌ No advertising
- ❌ No analytics sharing
- ❌ No third-party data sales
- ❌ No persistent tracking beyond the bot session

---

### 🗑️ Data Lifespan & Control
- Vibe and cozyspace data clears after 24h inactivity
- Users can opt out of stored preferences or wipe memory with `/reset`
- NSFW features are **disabled by default** and require opt-in

---

### 🛡️ Your Privacy Matters
BinkoBot is designed with **user consent and comfort first**. Whether you're here for cozy affirmations, flirtatious chaos, or just a listening space—your data stays private.
